# Food Truck Project

## Details
This program allows the user to input up to five Food Truck names, the type of food they serve, 
and their rating (from 1-5). The program creates an instance of the FoodTruck class for each truck 
and assigns the values to the object's fields. The user is able to enter less than five trucks by 
entering "quit" as a food truck name. After entering food trucks, a menu is displayed for the user 
to choose between all trucks entered, average rating of all trucks, the highest rated truck, and 
quitting the program.

## What I Learned
This project allowed me to gain more experience with classes. It also helped me get a better 
understanding of static and non static objects.
